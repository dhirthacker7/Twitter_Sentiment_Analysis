## Project Overview  
This project focuses on extracting, processing, and analyzing Twitter data to determine sentiment trends. By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques and leveraging machine learning models, it helps uncover public sentiment patterns and visualize them effectively.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **APIs**: Twitter API for data extraction  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `tweepy` for accessing Twitter data  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation  
  - `nltk` and `TextBlob` for sentiment analysis  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization  
  - `wordcloud` for generating word clouds  

---

## Key Features  

### 1. Twitter Data Extraction  
- Collect tweets using the Twitter API based on specific keywords or hashtags.  
- Filter tweets by language, time range, and user preferences.  

---

### 2. Sentiment Analysis  
- Use `TextBlob` and `nltk` for sentiment classification into positive, negative, and neutral categories.  
- Apply machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) for enhanced sentiment prediction.  

---

### 3. Visualization of Sentiment Trends  
- Generate bar charts, pie charts, and time-series plots to visualize sentiment distributions.  
- Create word clouds to highlight commonly used terms in positive and negative tweets.  

---

## Setup Instructions  

### 1. Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/dhirthacker7/twitter_sentiment_analysis.git  
cd twitter_sentiment_analysis  
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

### 3. Setup Twitter API Keys
Create a Twitter Developer account and obtain API keys.
Store the keys in a .env file with the following format:
```bash
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key  
TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token  
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
```

### 4. Run the Project
Start the analysis by running the main Python script:
```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

## Insights and Visualizations
### Sentiment Distribution
Visualize the proportion of positive, negative, and neutral tweets for a given keyword.
### Trending Topics
Identify trending hashtags and phrases associated with the analyzed sentiment.
### Temporal Analysis
Explore how public sentiment changes over time for specific events or topics.
### Word Clouds
Highlight frequently used terms for positive and negative tweets, providing contextual insights.

## Future Enhancements
#### Integrate deep learning models (e.g., transformers) for more accurate sentiment classification.
#### Expand the project to analyze data from multiple social media platforms.
#### Implement a web-based interface using Streamlit for user-friendly sentiment exploration.
