## Project Overview  
This project focuses on extracting, processing, and analyzing Twitter data to determine sentiment trends. By applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques and leveraging machine learning models, it helps uncover public sentiment patterns and visualize them effectively.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **APIs**: Twitter API for data extraction  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `tweepy` for accessing Twitter data  
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation  
  - `nltk` and `TextBlob` for sentiment analysis  
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization  
  - `wordcloud` for generating word clouds  

---

## Key Features  

### 1. Twitter Data Extraction  
- Collect tweets using the Twitter API based on specific keywords or hashtags.  
- Filter tweets by language, time range, and user preferences.  

---

### 2. Sentiment Analysis  
- Use `TextBlob` and `nltk` for sentiment classification into positive, negative, and neutral categories.  
- Apply machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) for enhanced sentiment prediction.  

---

### 3. Visualization of Sentiment Trends  
- Generate bar charts, pie charts, and time-series plots to visualize sentiment distributions.  
- Create word clouds to highlight commonly used terms in positive and negative tweets.
